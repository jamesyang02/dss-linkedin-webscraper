This project is still in its baby stage! Bugs are likely.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- Uncaught exceptions will cause program to crash, which may leave invisible Chrome sessions.
- You cannot exit the GUI from the X button (for now). Use the Exit button provided on the interface instead.
- Crash when inputting company/job info the second time (due to improper search results the first time). Try to spell everything correctly for now!
